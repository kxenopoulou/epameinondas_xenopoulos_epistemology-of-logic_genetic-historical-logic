# Repository for the Study and Formalization of Dialectical Logic  
## According to the Work of the Greek Philosopher **Epameinondas Xenopoulos**

This repository formalizes the work of **Epameinondas Xenopoulos**,  
*Epistemology of Logic: Logic–Dialectic or Theory of Knowledge*  
(1st ed. 1998, 2nd ed. 2024), into modern theoretical, mathematical, and computational frameworks.

Drawing on **2,500 years of Greek philosophical tradition**, the project introduces a rigorous approach to reasoning that systematically addresses **contradiction, temporality, and qualitative transformation**, with direct relevance to **logic, epistemology, and Artificial Intelligence**.

Xenopoulos synthesized the **static precision of formal logic (Hilbert)** with the **dynamic genesis of cognitive structures (Piaget)**, forging a new and more powerful instrument of thought — a genuine **Novum Organum**.  
For this radical synthesis, Xenopoulos has been characterized as an **“Einstein of Dialectical Logic.”**

## 📘 Purpose of the Repository

This repository was created **with authorization and under the full supervision of the legal heirs** of Epameinondas Xenopoulos. Its aims are:

- To provide a **systematic and faithful presentation** of the theory of **formal‑dialectical logic** as developed in *Epistemology of Logic* (2nd ed., 2024).
- To undertake the **mathematical formalization and axiomatization** of the core structures of the theory:
  - Propositional Matrix of the World **M(t)**
  - Multi‑valued truth systems
  - Formal‑dialectical operators
  - Dialectical logic of contradiction
- To construct an **open academic research framework** for theoretical study, modeling, simulation, and pedagogy, with absolute respect for the author’s intellectual vision.

## 🧩 Core Concepts (Synoptic)

- **Formal‑Dialectical Logic**:  
  A higher synthesis of formal logic and dialectics — not a rejection of classical logic, but its integration into a dynamic, historical, and temporal framework.

- **Propositional Matrix of the World M(t)**:  
  A dynamic structure  
  `P(x,y,z,t) = [v, τ, σ]`  
  where truth values evolve in time, velocity, and phase.

- **Contradiction as Motive Force**:  
  Not an error, but the internal engine of development and qualitative change.

- **Negation of the Negation**:  
  The historical law governing the evolution of logical thought itself.
