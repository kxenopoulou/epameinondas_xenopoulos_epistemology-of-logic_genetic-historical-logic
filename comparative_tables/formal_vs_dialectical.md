# Comparative Table: Formal (Traditional) Logic vs. Dialectical Logic (Xenopoulos)

This table compares the fundamental characteristics of formal (traditional/static) logic and dialectical logic as presented in Epameinondas Xenopoulos's work. All entries are derived directly from explicit statements in the text.

| Characteristic                  | Formal (Traditional/Static) Logic                                                                                                     | Dialectical Logic (Xenopoulos)                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Philosophical Origin**        | Parmenidean (pp. 10, 15, 33, 48, 271)                                                                                               | Heraclitean/Hegelian (pp. 10, 15, 274)                                                                                           |
| **Fundamental Principle of Identity** | A = A (at the same moment) (pp. 10, 16, 48, 271)                                                                                  | A = A and not-A at the same moment (pp. 10, 33)                                                                                  |
| **Fundamental Principle of Contradiction** | A.~A = 0 (Non-contradiction) (pp. 10, 16, 271)                                                                                        | A.~A = S (Synthesis) (p. 49) / Principle of contradiction: A ≠ A (p. 10)                                                         |
| **Principle of Excluded Middle** | A ∨ ~A (pp. 10, 271)                                                                                                                | Not applicable in its classical form; superseded by the spectrum of truth values and synthesis.                                  |
| **View of Being (Ontology)**    | Static, immutable being (Eἶναι). Sees things as isolated, fixed, and unchanging in their essence (pp. 10, 27-28, 48-49, 52).        | Dynamic becoming (Γίγνεσθαι). Sees things in motion, change, interconnection, and historical development (pp. 10, 15, 28, 34).   |
| **Nature of Logical Categories** | Rigid, fixed, unchanging categories (p. 38).                                                                                        | Fluid, flexible categories that adapt to new content (p. 38).                                                                    |
| **Role of Contradiction**       | To be avoided at all costs. Contradiction signifies error or logical impossibility (A.~A = 0) (pp. 10, 29).                         | The motive force of development and change. It is internal to things and is resolved through synthesis (pp. 26-27, 29, 37, 54). |
| **Temporal Dimension**          | Timeless (achronic). Makes an abstraction of time and motion (pp. 16, 34).                                                           | Time is inherent. Logic incorporates temporal process and change (M(t)) (pp. 24, 34-35, 247-249).                                |
| **Truth Values**                | Two-valued: {0, 1} (True/False) (p. 24).                                                                                            | Multi-valued spectrum: {0, ½v, ½²v, ..., 1}. Intermediate values represent qualitative states and transitions (pp. 10-11, 35).   |
| **Primary Cognitive Function**  | Analysis, classification, and identification of static objects. Works on terms and symbols of propositions (pp. 20, 33-34, 40).     | Synthesis, understanding of processes, and grasping qualitative transformations. Works on the object itself through concepts.    |
| **Direction of Thought**        | From sign to sign (syntactic movement) (pp. 30, 36, 43).                                                                             | From concept to concept, from meaning to meaning (semantic movement) (pp. 30, 43-44).                                           |
| **Type of Reasoning**           | Formal deduction (production). Derives new propositions from given ones using fixed rules (pp. 21, 32).                            | Dialectical reasoning. Moves through contradiction (thesis-antithesis) to reach a higher synthesis (pp. 22, 26, 37, 54).        |
| **Model of the World**          | Propositional functions on static arguments: f(x) where f is a fixed predicate (p. 40).                                             | Propositional Matrix of the World M(t): P(x,y,z,t)=[v,τ,σ], dynamic and time-dependent (pp. 247-249).                            |
| **Law of Change**               | Not applicable. Assumes stability.                                                                                                  | For every proposition P: lim(t→t₀) P(t) ≠ P(t₀), except in equilibrium stages (p. 249).                                         |
| **Epistemological Goal**        | Guarantee of validity and non-contradiction in reasoning. "First guarantee of the meaning of the word and communication" (p. 49).    | Deeper and more complete knowledge of the moving object. Foundation for synthetic activity of thought (pp. 30, 33, 43).         |
| **Relation to Subject-Object**  | Can be considered independently of the concrete subject (as in logical empiricism) (p. 42).                                          | Arises from the correlation and interpenetration of subject and object in practical activity (pp. 11, 23, 42, 45).              |
| **Historical Emergence**        | First negation: emerges from the "Total Logos" as its opposite, representing the tendency of thought to see the world in stasis.     | Second negation (negation of the negation): overcomes static logic, synthesizing it within a higher, dynamic organization.       |
| **Status in Xenopoulos's System** | A moment (a "static snapshot") within the total dialectical process of thought. Constitutes the "formal-dialectical" synthesis.      | The higher, comprehensive logical organon that includes and transcends formal logic, aiming for a "Novum Organum."              |
