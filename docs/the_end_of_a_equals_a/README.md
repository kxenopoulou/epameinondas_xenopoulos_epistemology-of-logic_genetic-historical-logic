# The End of A = A: Xenopoulos and the Logic of Becoming

This document develops the central theoretical thesis of
Epameinondas Xenopoulos’ *Epistemology of Logic*:
that the classical law of identity (A = A) is not abolished,
but historically superseded through dialectical‑genetic logic.

The text articulates the distinction between:
- logical transformation, and
- ontological / epistemological qualitative leap,

and situates dialectical‑genetic logic as a logic of becoming.
