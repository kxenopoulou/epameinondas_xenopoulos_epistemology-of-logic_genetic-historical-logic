# Identity and Becoming

Classical formal logic is founded on the law of identity:

A = A

This law presupposes that entities are self-identical, stable, and
logically complete at any given moment. Change, when acknowledged,
is treated as an external modification applied to an otherwise
self-same object.

In Epameinondas Xenopoulos’ dialectical‑genetic logic, identity is not
abolished but reconceptualized. Identity is understood as genetic and
historical rather than static. An entity is not what it simply is, but
what it becomes through internal contradiction.

Thus, identity takes the form:

A → A′

where A′ is not accidental variation, but the necessary historical
outcome of A’s internal tensions.

Becoming is therefore not empirical motion added to logic, but a
logical necessity arising from contradiction. Identity is preserved
only through transformation.

The “end of A = A” does not signify logical collapse, but the end of
identity as timeless self-sameness. It marks the transition to identity
as a process of becoming.
