# Logical Transformation

At the logical level, the transition from formal logic to
dialectical‑genetic logic must be understood as a transformation rather
than a simple negation.

Formal logic remains valid within its historical domain. Its principles
of consistency, inference, and determination are not discarded. They
are, however, re-situated within a broader logical architecture.

Dialectical‑genetic logic transforms formal logic by:
- internalizing contradiction,
- incorporating temporality as a logical dimension,
- and redefining negation as opposition rather than exclusion.

This transformation is logical because it proceeds from the internal
limits of formal logic itself. When contradiction and change are
systematically excluded, logic becomes incapable of accounting for
historical development, scientific revolutions, or systemic crises.

The transformation does not deny formal logic; it explains its
historical necessity and its limits.

At this level, the relation is one of logical continuity under
reorganization.
